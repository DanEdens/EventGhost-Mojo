0. Use trunk-based development with feature branches
1. Work on the code problem asked, implementing it without harming existing methods, Ask if unsure.
3. Maintain a "Lessons Learned.md" file to document what you've learned.
4. Update readme.md and TODO.md with progress after completing features
5. Git workflow rules:
   - Avoid using commands that trigger a pager (git diff, git log, etc.) This is a windows machine.
   - include any information you might need to know later to prevent duplicate work.
6. Command execution rules:
   - Avoid newlines in command strings
   - Use semicolons or && for multiple commands instead of newlines
   - Escape special characters in command strings
   - Set appropriate flags to prevent interactive prompts
