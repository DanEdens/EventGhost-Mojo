Current Status of main_frame.rs
Based on your message, the src/eg/classes/main_frame.rs file remains identical to the original version. This indicates that none of the modifications or implementations specific to the Rust version of MainFrame have been completed yet.

Steps Outlined in the README
To effectively reproduce the Python MainFrame in Rust, you have a structured approach outlined in your readme.md. Here's a brief overview of what each section entails and how they relate to the current state of main_frame.rs:
Implementing the MainFrame Struct

Status: Not Accomplished
Action Needed: Define the MainFrame struct with appropriate fields for UI components like toolbar, status_bar, tree_ctrl, and log_ctrl.
Creating UI Components in Rust

Status: Partially Accomplished
Action Needed: Implement each UI component (Toolbar, StatusBar, TreeCtrl, LogCtrl) in Rust. Ensure that their initialization and event handling are correctly set up.
Event Handling

Status: Not Accomplished
Action Needed: Implement the window_proc function to handle Windows messages and route events to the appropriate UI components.
Layout Management

Status: Not Accomplished
Action Needed: Develop the layout_controls method to correctly position and size UI components within the main window.
Memory and Resource Management

Status: Not Accomplished
Action Needed: Implement the Drop trait to ensure that resources like windows and controls are properly released when MainFrame is dropped.
Logging and Error Handling

Status: Not Accomplished
Action Needed: Integrate logging mechanisms to display logs within LogCtrl and handle errors gracefully, updating the StatusBar as needed.
Testing

Status: Not Accomplished
Action Needed: Develop unit and integration tests to ensure that MainFrame and its components function as expected.
Maintaining UI Consistency

Status: Not Accomplished
Action Needed: Ensure that the Rust UI mirrors the Python version in terms of layout, behavior, and aesthetics.
