2. Display Control System
   - Monitor power states
   - Display settings management
   - Wallpaper control
   - Screen saver management
   - Multi-monitor support
   - Image display capabilities

3. Audio Control System
   - Volume management
   - Mute control
   - Sound playback
   - Multiple device support
   - Audio event monitoring
   - Device enumeration

4. System Integration

Migration Considerations
---------------------
1. Core Functionality Migration
   - Port Windows API calls to safe Rust bindings
   - Implement proper privilege management
   - Handle system events safely
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Ensure proper resource cleanup

2. Event System
   - Design event notification system
   - Handle power broadcast events
   - Manage device change notifications
   - Session change monitoring
   - Audio event handling

3. Resource Management
   - Safe handle management
   - Proper privilege cleanup
   - Thread safety considerations
   - Memory management
   - Device resource handling

Implementation Strategy
--------------------
1. Power Management
   .. code-block:: rust

   pub struct PowerManager {
       privileges: SystemPrivileges,
       broadcast_receiver: PowerBroadcastReceiver,
       session_monitor: SessionMonitor,
   }

   impl PowerManager {
       pub fn shutdown(&self, force: bool) -> Result<(), Error> {
           // Validate privileges
           // Handle force close
           // Execute shutdown
           // Monitor result
       }
   }

2. Display Control
   .. code-block:: rust

   pub struct DisplayManager {
       monitors: Vec<Monitor>,
       settings: DisplaySettings,
       wallpaper: WallpaperManager,
   }

   impl DisplayManager {
       pub fn set_power_state(&mut self, state: PowerState) -> Result<(), Error> {
           // Validate state
           // Apply power state
           // Handle errors
           // Monitor changes
       }
   }

Testing Strategy
-------------
1. Unit Tests
   - Power management functions
   - Display control operations
   - Audio system functions
   - Registry operations
   - Event handling

2. Integration Tests
   - System state changes
   - Power management flow
   - Audio device interaction
   - Multi-monitor scenarios
   - Event system integration

3. Security Tests
   - Privilege management
   - Registry access control
   - System operation permissions
   - Resource access validation
   - Error handling

Error Handling
------------
1. System Operations
   - Privilege errors
   - Operation failures
   - Resource access issues
   - State transition errors
   - Device access problems

2. Resource Management
   - Handle cleanup
   - Memory management
   - Thread safety
   - Device resources
   - Event handling

3. User Interaction
   - Invalid parameters
   - Missing permissions
   - Device unavailable
   - Operation timeout
   - State conflicts

Platform Considerations
--------------------
1. Windows Integration
   - Windows API usage
   - Registry interaction
   - Power management
   - Display control
   - Audio system

2. Cross-Platform Support
   - Abstract system operations
   - Platform-specific implementations
   - Resource management
   - Event system
   - Error handling
