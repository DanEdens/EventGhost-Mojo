# EventGhost-Rust Plugins Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for all plugins in the EventGhost-Rust project. Each plugin is documented in RST format, providing comprehensive information about its functionality, implementation details, and migration status from Python to Rust.

## Documentation Structure

The plugins are organized into several categories:

### Complete Analysis with Rust Implementation
- `global_monitor.rst` - Global system monitoring capabilities
- `mouse.rst` - Mouse event handling and control

### Core Components and Migration Analysis
- `eventghost_core.rst` - Core EventGhost functionality
- `keyboard.rst` - Keyboard event handling
- `system.rst` - System-level operations
- `radiosure.rst` - Radio control functionality

### Initial Analysis
- `file_operations.rst` - File system operations
- `directory_watcher.rst` - Directory monitoring

### Remaining Core Plugins
- `window.rst` - Window management
- `task.rst` - Task scheduling and management
- `network.rst` - Network operations

### Additional Plugins
- `process_watcher.rst` - Process monitoring
- `speech.rst` - Text-to-speech capabilities
- `scheduleghost.rst` - Advanced scheduling
- `timer.rst` - Timer functionality
- `serial.rst` - Serial port communication
- `ping.rst` - Network ping utilities
- `mqtt.rst` - MQTT protocol support
- `google_chrome.rst` - Chrome browser integration

## Documentation Format

Each plugin documentation file follows a standard RST format including:
1. Overview and purpose
2. Configuration options
3. Events generated/handled
4. Actions provided
5. Implementation details
6. Migration notes from Python to Rust

## Contributing

When adding new plugin documentation:
1. Use the `template.rst` as a starting point
2. Follow the established RST formatting
3. Include all necessary sections
4. Update the `index.rst` to include your new plugin
5. Ensure proper categorization in the documentation structure
